This is an alternate Redis driver for Ruby. 

  Goals:
    - DON'T LEAK
    - support ruby 1.9+
    - be small
    - be quick
    - don't be dead
 
  Ungoals:
    - handholding

Many gems that we have tried to use don't behave very well in a production
environment. Mostly they are too bloated and have nasty memory leaks.
Instead of trying to fix all of them, we decided to write our own libs
when possible.

Salvatore does amazing stuff on Redis and his protocol is very simple and
easy to implement. This lib only takes care of the functions that we
use ourselves. Currently the code is alpha quality but works-for-us and

== Design Decisions

  - Sockets are kept open between requests. If Redis closes the socket, we 
try to reconnect on write.

  - The Redis protocol doesn't make any assumptions about char encodings.
We force ASCII_8BIT on all strings because Redis counts bytes, not
characters. On the strings that you do use, you can force_encoding to
whatever you're using (UTF-8?).

  - Tests will we added as soon as we have time to look for and evaluate
mocks for the Redis protocol.
